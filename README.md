# ICP_3D_displ_from_topo
#  We use a windowed implementation of the Iterative Closest Point algorithm 
# (ICP; Besl & McKay, 1992; Chen &Medioni, 1992) to calculate the 3-D surface deformation 
# from high resolution topography that span an earthquake.

#This code requires the following codes from the Matlab File Exchange:

#Snippets of the lidar topography that span the 2016 Kumamoto, Japan, Earthquake are available here:
